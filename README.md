Paper 1 - End to End Arguments in System Design

In this paper the authors argue that certain functions within a netwrok are best addressed by migrating them to end points i.e. applications. This translates to essentially having a "dumb network" and smart/intelligent applications. This end to end argument supports a pragmatic way to place low level abstractions within a network whilst moving the application level services up the stack.
